# Green Split Pea Soup

Makes 12 servings. 

Active prep time – 25 minutes

Cook time – 45 minutes

```
1 lb dried green split peas, rinsed
1 lb carrots, washed and peeled
3/4 lb celery, washed
1 large red onion, peeled and minced
4 strips thin sliced bacon
48 oz. chicken stock
```

Place rinsed green split peas into a large soup pot. Add cold water to the pot until the water is 1 inch above the highest pea. Cover and soak for at least 12 hours.

After the peas have soaked for 12 hours, bring the soup pot’s contents to a simmer. Meanwhile: 

In a large frying pan, fry the 4 strips of bacon until crisp. Discard half of the bacon fat, and set the cooked bacon aside. 

Peel and finely chop the carrots, celery (don’t discard the leaves), and red onion.  Sauté the red onion in the remaining half of the bacon fat (keep the pan covered, and stir frequently to coat the onions with the bacon fat) until the onion is translucent, about 15 minutes. Add the celery and cover again. Remove from heat. 

Crumble the bacon and add to the soup pot along with the carrots, celery, and red onion. Add the broth and continue to add water until desired consistency (probably at least 3 or 4 cups of water). Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for approximately 45 minutes.

Serve with freshly ground black pepper, and optionally freshly grated parmesean cheese and toasted crouton. The salt from the bacon and stock should be enough, but if it’s not, salt to taste as well
