##The Method

Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C). 

In a small mixing bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. 

In another bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the milk and blackberry coulis. Set aside. 

In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugars on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl between additions.

* Add half of the dry ingredients to the bowl of the mixer and mix on low speed until just combined.
* Mix in the blackberry coulis/milk mixture. 
* Mix in the remaining dry ingredients on low speed just until  incorporated. Do not over-mix. 

Line a cupcake pan with paper liners. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared paper liners. Bake 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan 10-15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool completely.

To make the frosting, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar and blackberry coulis in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed until smooth and well blended. Frost cooled cupcakes as desired and garnish with fresh blackberries.
