# Whipping Cream Pancakes
  
I have thoroughly searched the internet and discovered there is no recipe for sweet cream pancakes. Why not? Restaurants (especially breakfast chains) commonly serve sweet cream pancakes. The first time I ever saw them advertised was at Black Bear Diner. How many chain-type restaurants do you know that make pancake batter from scratch? I’m guessing few?

The secret ingredient to Sweet Cream Pancakes, I’m convinced is, Sweet Cream or Buttermilk Powder. Yes, you read that correct. Powder! Yuck to putting powder in pancakes (other than baking powder, of course).

The whole reason that I began searching for sweet cream pancake recipes in the first place is because a) I love eating pancakes on the weekend and b) I have a crap tone of whipping cream in my fridge leftover from the holidays. What I wanted was a recipe that used some damn whipping cream in the batter. Nary a recipe could I find. What I did find was a ‘sweet cream’ recipe for waffles (using whipping cream). I decided to test it out on my pancake griddle instead of in my waffle iron.

## ingredients.

* 2 c. flour
* 1 T. baking powder
* 1 tsp. salt
* 2 T. sugar
* 4 eggs, separated
* 2 c. heavy cream
* 4 T. butter, melted

## directions.

Heat a frying pan or skillet on the stove top. (I like to use two small, about 8-inch, cast iron skillets. With these skillets I heat over medium-low heat usually having to adjust the temperature up or down slightly if the pancakes are browning too much or not browning enough.) Add a little vegetable oil, vegetable shortening, butter to the frying pan. (If you prefer to used cooking spray, I would wait to spray right before pouring the batter.)
In a large bowl whisk until well mixed the cream, butter and egg yolks. Add sugar, salt and baking powder. The mixture will double in volume and become thick.
Beat the egg whites until stiff, then fold them gently into the batter. Add in the flour.
Ladle out 1/4 cup of pancake batter at a time, and cook until browned on one side – about two minutes. Flip over and cook until browned on the other side.. Repeat until batter is gone. Serve hot with butter and your favorite flavor of syrup (mine is golden syrup).

These pancakes are solid. Taste like regular pancakes, nothing special, but good nonetheless. They’re pancakes for crying out loud. How could they be bad?

I’d like to try the recipe again sometime only because when I was making this the doubling/thickening of the batter caught me off guard (the original recipe didn’t warn me of this). Because the batter got so thick before I had even added the flour, I ended up thinning it out with about a cup or so of milk. The batter was still thick/voluminous but I found that the end result was a relatively flat pancake. I had assumed the pancakes would turn out substantially thick due to the stiffened egg whites and voluminous batter. The moral of the story is I would not mess around with the ingredients the next time in an effort to yield thick and fluffy pancakes.
