Karaage with Potato Starch vs. Corn Starch

In Japan potato starch (or katakuriko 片栗粉) is most commonly used as a coating for deep frying instead of corn starch.  I was using corn starch when I first moved to the U.S. because it was easier to find at regular American supermarkets.

As we often substitute corn starch for potato starch or vice versa, I didn’t think too much.  However, when I compared potato and corn starch side by side by rubbing them between my finger tips, I noticed they are quite different in texture.  So I’ve decided to make karaage with these two types of starch and see which karaage tastes better.

As a result, I found out that potato starch seemed to be crispier and had a nice crisp texture when I bite into it.  That’s something we look for when we eat karaage in general.  If you cannot find potato starch, corn starch is still your best option.  However, I think it’s worth your time looking for potato starch for this delicious karaage.

Are Potato Starch and Potato Flour Same?

No, they are not the same.  Potato starch is made from the dried starch component of peeled potatoes while potato flour is made from whole (raw or cooked) potatoes being dried then ground into flour.

### INGREDIENTS

* 1 lb chicken thigh
* Sea salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 cup potato starch/corn starch
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc) (for deep frying)

Seasonings:

* 1 inch ginger
* 8 cloves garlic (You can adjust as you like)
* 1 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp sake (or dry sherry)
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp sugar

Garnish
* Lemon (for taste and garnish)
* Parsley (for garnish)
* Japanese mayonnaise (optional for dipping)
* Shichimi Togarashi (Japanese seven spice) (optional for spicy taste)

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Gather all the ingredients.
2. Pat dry the chicken with paper towel. Cut each chicken thigh into 2 inch pieces (so that deep frying time is about the same). Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Put the chicken in a large bowl or Ziploc bag.
3. Grate the ginger and mince the garlic (with garlic presser).
4. Combine the chicken and all the seasonings in the bowl (or Ziploc bag). Cover with plastic wrap and rest in refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
5. Bring the oil to 320-338F (160-170C).
6. Meanwhile combine potato starch and flour, and whisk all together.
7. Right before the oil is ready, add the potato starch and flour mix to the chicken. You do not need to mix it evenly. The uneven coating gives each piece its unique texture.
8. Gently drop each piece of chicken separately into the oil. Do not overcrowd. Deep fry 3-5 pieces at a time. If you put a lot of chicken in the oil, the temperature will drop quickly and chicken will end up absorbing too much oil.
9. Cook for 90 seconds, or until the chicken is cooked through and outside is light golden color. If the chicken changes color too quickly, then the oil temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces of chicken in the oil or lower the heat. Controlling oil temperature is the key for deep frying.
10. Transfer the chicken onto a wire rack to drain excess oil. While resting on the wire rack, the chicken will continue to cook with the remaining heat.
11. Between batches (or even while cooking), make sure to pick up crumbs to keep the oil clean (otherwise oil will get darker).
12. When you finish all the batches, then bring the oil to 356F (180C).
13. Deep fry for the second time for 45 seconds, or until the skin is nice golden color and crispy.
14. Transfer the chicken onto a wire rack or paper towel to drain excess oil. Serve the chicken immediately with lemon wedges.
