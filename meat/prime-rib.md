## INGREDIENTS

```
1 cup butter, softened
7 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped

2 tablespoons flour
2 cups beef stock

Green beans, to serve
```

## PREPARATION

Ben's note: I prefer to slow roast the rib at 230°F for 6-7 hours

1. Preheat oven to 500°F/260°C.
2. Mix together the butter, garlic, herbs, salt, and pepper in a bowl until evenly combined.
3. Rub the herb butter all over the rib roast, then place on a roasting tray with a rack.
4. Bake for 5 minutes per pound of meat — so a 5-pound roast would bake for 25 minutes and a 7-pound roast would bake for 35 minutes.
5. Turn off the heat and let the rib roast sit in the oven for 2 hours, making sure you do not open the oven door or else the residual heat will escape.
6. Once the 2 hours are up, remove the roast from the pan and pour the pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. 
7. Add the flour, whisking until there are no lumps, then add the beef stock, stirring and bringing the sauce to a boil.
8. Remove from heat and strain the sauce into a gravy dish.
9. Carve the prime rib into ¾-inch slices, then serve with the mashed potatoes, green beans, and sauce!
10. Enjoy!
