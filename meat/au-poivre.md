# Filet au Poivre
```
3 T   olive oil
1 T   chopped parsley
1 T   chopped shallots
1 T   coarse sea salt 
1 t.  herbes de Provence
3 T   coarsely ground black pepper (I probably donít use that much)
4 lb. beef tenderloin
```

One day before serving combine all the ingredients except the meat.  Rub the mixture evenly all over the tenderloin.  Place the meat in a covered dish or in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

Roast the tenderloin for 25-30 minutes in a 425 degree oven or until temperature registers 120 degrees on a meat thermometer.  Let sit 10-15 minutes before carving.  The recipe says this serves twelve people.  I say, ìHa!î  Certainly not if the people are TAs or graduate students.  This recipe scales up easily, but the roasting takes longer if you have an 8 lb. roast.  The proportions of the coating mixture do not have to be exact; I probably use more parsley and shallots than the recipe says.
