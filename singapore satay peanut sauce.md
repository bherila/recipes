Singapore Satay Peanut Sauce

(credits to kitchen tigress for her brilliant research into getting that perfect consistency and golden hue in the peanut sauce)

makes 1 cup

* 250g toasted peanuts, skinless
* 1 tbsp tamarind (assam) pulp, mashed with 1/2 cup of warm water
* 4 shallots
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 stalk lemongrass, white part only
* 2 slices galangal
* 3-4 dried red chillies
* 3 tbsp groundnut oil 
* 4 tbsp unrefined sugar (palm sugar aka gula melaka is great. Its unique sweet taste is popular in Singaporean cooking. It will give a much darker sauce though.)
* 1 tsp naturally brewed soy sauce
